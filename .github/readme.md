# 🧬 GitHub CI/CD Pipeline System

This directory implements a robust continuous integration and delivery platform leveraging GitHub Actions for end-to-end automation of the software delivery lifecycle.

## ⚙️ Core Workflow Components

### `terraform.yml`
Comprehensive infrastructure validation workflow:
- Syntax validation (`terraform validate`)
- Security scanning (`checkov`, `tfsec`)
- Cost estimation (`infracost`)
- Plan artifact generation
- PR status reporting

### `apply_terraform.yml`
Production-grade deployment workflow:
- Manual approval gates
- Environment-specific apply strategies
- State file management
- Post-deploy verification
- Notification integration

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

1. **Validation Stage**
   - Code linting (markdown, YAML, HCL)
   - Unit testing
   - Dependency scanning

2. **Build Stage**
   - Immutable artifact creation
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Compliance checks

3. **Deployment Stage**
   - Environment promotion
   - Canary deployment support
   - Rollback capabilities

## 🔐 Security Framework

- OIDC integration for AWS credentials
- Ephemeral runners with hardened images
- Secret rotation policies
- Branch protection rules
- Codeowner enforcement

## 📈 Advanced Features

- Performance benchmarking
- Deployment analytics
- Incident integration (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- ChatOps integration (Slack, MS Teams)
