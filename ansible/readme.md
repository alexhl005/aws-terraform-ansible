# üõ†Ô∏è Ansible Automation Framework

This directory contains the comprehensive infrastructure automation solution powered by Ansible, serving as the backbone for consistent and repeatable environment provisioning across all deployment stages.

## üìÇ Directory Structure Overview

### `inventories/`
Environment-specific inventory definitions with dynamic grouping capabilities:
- `dev/` - Development environment with test instances
- `prod/` - Production environment with high-availability configurations
- Custom inventory plugins for AWS EC2 dynamic discovery

### `playbooks/`
Orchestration playbooks implementing deployment strategies:
- `configure_infra.yml` - Base infrastructure provisioning (security hardening, package management)
- `deploy_app.yml` - Zero-downtime application deployment with rolling updates
- `maintenance.yml` - Scheduled maintenance operations (log rotation, DB backups)

### `roles/`
Reusable component modules following Ansible best practices:
- `app_server/` - Full application stack configuration (web servers, runtimes, dependencies)
- `db_setup/` - Database provisioning with replication and backup configuration
- `monitoring/` - Centralized monitoring stack (metrics collection, alerting rules)
- `security/` - CIS benchmark compliance and security hardening

### `vars/`
Hierarchical variable architecture:
- Environment-specific overrides (`dev_vars.yml`, `prod_vars.yml`)
- Role-specific variables
- Secret management with Ansible Vault integration
